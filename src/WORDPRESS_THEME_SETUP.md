**⚠️ This theme setup guide is not needed for your headless WordPress configuration.**

## 🎯 **Current Setup: Headless WordPress**

Your WordPress runs as a **headless CMS** - the frontend theme is **not used** because your React application handles all frontend rendering.

**Refer to:** `WORDPRESS_SETUP.md` for headless WordPress configuration.

## 📋 **Why No Theme Setup?**

In your **headless architecture:**
- **React app** handles all frontend rendering
- **WordPress** only provides content via REST API
- **WordPress theme** is not displayed to users
- **WordPress admin** is used only for content management

---

**Your React frontend delivers the complete user experience while WordPress serves as a powerful content management backend.**
